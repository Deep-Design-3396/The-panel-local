                <p>The CCL test is generally taken by the applicants who are looking to lodge a point-based visa
                    application. On successfully passing the test, applicants are awarded five points towards the

                <p>These points are also referred to as Credentialed Community Language Points, and candidates should

                <p>The test consists of two dialogue recordings. Each dialogue represents a conversation between a
                    native
                    English Speaker and a native Language Other Than English (LOTE) speaker. Each dialogue is
                    approximately
                    300 words, with about half in English and half in the LOTE. The dialogues are divided into segments
                    of
                    35 words or less.</p>
                <p>Further information can be found through the Candidate Instructions. As CCL tests are online,

                <h3>How Is The Test Assessed?</h3>
                <p class="text-center">A minimum of two examiners will assess a candidate’s ability to communicate
                    effectively in English
                    and a
                    LOTE.</p>
                <p>Two significant factors that contribute to assessment are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Language Quality - competency in both English and LOTE</li>
                    <li>Language Register - the level of formality with which a candidate transfers the meaning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Marks are deducted for errors. Examiners consider the types of errors in your performance and how
                    these
                    impact on your overall communication.</p>
                <p>Errors for which the examiners deduct a candidate's score are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accuracy (correctness of information)</li>
                    <li>Distortions (misrepresentation of information)</li>
                    <li>Omissions (removal of information)</li>
                    <li>Insertions (addition of information)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each examiner awards your results individually. In situations where the examiners disagree about the
                    performance of a candidate, additional examiners will assess your test to help determine your final
                    result.</p>

                <h3>How Is The Test Marked?</h3>
                <p class="text-center">The test comprises of two dialogues; each worth 45 marks. In order to pass the
                    test, a candidate
                    requires at least 29 marks in each dialogue and an overall score of 63 out of 90.</p>
                <p>The result for the CCL test will be given as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pass: 63 or higher (marks out of 90)</li>
                    <li>Marginal Fail: between 58 and 62.5 (marks out of 90)</li>
                    <li>Clear Fail: less than 58 (marks out of 90)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In situations where a candidate achieves 23 out of 45 in Dialogue 1, 41 out of 45 in Dialogue 2 and
                    an Overall Score of 64 out of 90, the result given will be CLEAR FAIL as the candidate hasn’t
                    achieved required score in Dialogue 1 (i.e. 29).</p>
                <p>Results are sent via email within 4-6 weeks of the test date and are valid for three years from the
                    date of issue.</p>
                <p>Clear Fail results are unable to apply for a review of their test due to the statistical
                    improbability of the result being overturned</p>
